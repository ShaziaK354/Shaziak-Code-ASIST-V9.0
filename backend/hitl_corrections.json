    "3e4751e962de81d8998baf1b9a9da119": "According to SAMM Table C1.T1, the Implementing Agency (IA) for the Navy is the Navy International Programs Office (NIPO)",
    "1d0a2ec70f4cbc6736c87bb1582c9ab3": "According to SAMM Section 5.3 following subsections, Price and Availability (P&A) data are requested when preliminary data are required by a partner nation or international organization for planning or in anticipation of a purchase under Foreign Military Sales (FMS). P&A data are rough order of magnitude estimates of cost and availability of defense articles or services. These estimates are sufficiently accurate for rough-order planning purposes but should not be used for budget purposes and are not commitments. P&A data are not valid for use in preparing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). The term P&A data is not used to reference data being developed for an LOA. Instead, data compiled for an LOA are referred to as LOA data (LOAD). When responding to requests for P&A data, the Implementing Agency (IA) ensures that:\n1. The DoD Component can recommend release of the articles and/or services.\n2. If the purchaser were to request an LOA, it could be provided (i.e., further clearances such as Congressional Notification (CN) or disclosure approval are obtainable).\n3. The purchaser knows to submit a Letter of Request (LOR) to request an LOA if it wants to pursue the purchase.\nMore information about P&As and P&A data can be found in SAMM Sections C5.3.2-C5.3.6 and SAMM Table C5.T5"
