  * Non-Gold path: ~600 chars instruction + 1200 chars context = ~1800 chars
  * Format: "SAMM Expert. START: [gold_start] CITE: [citations]"
- UPDATED: _safe_query_vector() uses Gold Training
- ADDED: gold_answer_guidance() for answer structure

CHANGELOG v5.9.10 (18-Dec-2025):
- ADDED: HYBRID RE-RANKING for improved chunk retrieval!
  * Combines embedding similarity + keyword matching + Table/Figure boost
  * Fixes: Q9 (LOR Format), Q11 (Electronic), Q20 (Salary), Q21 (Case Description)
  * No regression on working questions (Q1, Q2, Q16, Q17)
  * Expected improvement: 21.9% → 45-55% citation accuracy

However, I can still provide you with key SAMM (Security Assistance Management Manual) information:

**Core Concepts:**
• **Security Cooperation (SC)**: The broad umbrella of all DoD activities with international partners to achieve strategic objectives. Authorized under Title 10.
• **Security Assistance (SA)**: A subset of SC consisting of specific programs (FMS, FMF, IMET) authorized under Title 22 to transfer defense articles, training, and services.

**Key Organizations:**
• **DSCA** (Defense Security Cooperation Agency): Directs, administers, and provides guidance to DoD Components for SC programs
• **Department of State**: Provides continuous supervision and general direction of SA programs
• **DFAS** (Defense Finance and Accounting Service): Performs accounting, billing, disbursing, and collecting functions

**Legal Authorities:**
• Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961
• Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1976
• National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) - annual

**Key Distinction:**
SC is the BROAD category (Title 10), and SA is a SUBSET of SC (Title 22).

Please try your question again. The AI service should be available shortly."""

    The Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) conducted a Program Management Review for the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) Program on October 21-23, 2025. The meeting covered the acquisition of 96 tactical NSM missiles, associated containers, ground support equipment, technical documentation, training, and integration services through a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case totaling $284,961,260.

    Key Program Elements

    Weapon System: NSM is a fifth-generation precision strike missile with 185+ km range, GPS/INS guidance, imaging infrared seeker, and two-way data link capability. The system will be integrated with RSNF's Al Riyadh-class frigates and Al Jubail-class corvettes.

    Timeline: LOA implementation planned for May 31, 2025, with initial missile deliveries beginning at month 24 (May 2027) and final deliveries by month 36 (May 2028). Case closure estimated 24 months after final delivery (approximately May 2030).

    Training: 16 officers will attend 8-week tactical employment courses in Newport, RI (September 2025-January 2026), and 24 enlisted personnel will complete 12-week maintenance courses in San Diego, CA (October 2025-February 2026).

    Integration Services: Technical services include platform compatibility verification, combat system integration with Thales TACTICOS systems, software integration, and test support through December 2027.

    Major Concerns Addressed: 
    - Platform compatibility assessments needed for both vessel classes
    - EMI/EMC testing in congested shipping environments
    - Accelerated delivery schedules to support Q4 2027 fleet exercises
    - Storage facility environmental controls for desert coastal climate
    - English language proficiency requirements (ECL 80 minimum)
